1,Empower Children And Their Families At Canossaville #SeasonOfGiving,"This is part of Canossaville's Season of Giving Campaign and contributions are multiplied through dollar matching by the Singapore Government and Tote Board. Please contribute generously to this meaningful cause.

Eighty years is a long time, but Canossaville Children and Community Services has stood the test of time as one of the oldest charities in Singapore.

Formerly a home for children, the charity has since started offering pre-school programmes and a student care catering to both mainstream children as well as children with hearing loss. The in-house Canossian Child Development Unit provides therapy support in areas such as speech and occupational therapy.

The charity is consistently expanding and supporting children and their families to help them reach their fullest potential. All these can only be made possible with kind support from donors like yourself.

Join me in doing my small part to raise funds to support their programmes and services for children from all race and faiths.

I hope to raise as much as possible to support the cause. Your small donation can make a world of difference to the children at Canossaville. Together we will raise a significant amount of donations.

100% of funds are channelled directly to Canossaville.

Thank you for donating to my appeal.

From Daren.All donations to the Season of Giving campaign shall be eligible for dollar matching by the Singapore Government and Tote Board up to cap of $250,000 per charity.

Every year, we all look forward to a special occasion. For some it could be a birthday, for others, a festive season such as Christmas. While we all celebrate these special occasions in our own ways, many also choose to give and share with others who need a little bit more help. 

At Canossaville Children and Community Services, our programmes and services are open to our children and their families all year round, with priority given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Education is at the core of what we do and our Canossian Circle of Care provides the supporting structure to children through a preschool, after-school care as well as a child development unit. 

This can only be made possible with the support of donors like yourself. We advocate for sustainable giving all year round to support all our programmes and services. In reality, donors tend to only donate at the end of the year during the season of giving. 

We acknowledge this and humbly seek your kind support for us to build up enough donations to sustain our programmes and services through the year. 

Thank you for not forgetting us during this season of giving. Your special thoughts warm the hearts of our children and their families under our care.
