1,Help Children with Hearing Loss Receive Early Intervention #SeasonOfGiving,"Your GIFT creates REAL impact!

Meet Charmaine (not her real name), a 3-year-old student who benefits from the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) for her hearing loss at Canossaville Preschool.

The Canossaville Preschool is the only mainstream preschool in Singapore with a specialisation of working with children with hearing loss, with intervention sessions held during curriculum hours.

It is a struggle for Charmaine's family to meet their daily needs. Charmaine's mother has to put aside money each month for Charmaine's brother who requires monthly occupational therapy at KKH. Charmaine's grandfather has a heart condition, and while he is able to work, most of his salary goes to his medical care.

To ease their burden, Canossaville subsidises half of Charmaine's preschool and school bus fees. We believe that a child's preschool years are crucial for their development, even more so for children with disabilities such as hearing loss.

Your donations will help us strive to do all we can for Charmaine and others like her by giving them the best possible start in their education.

This is an impact story as part of Canossaville's Season Of Giving Campaign. Donations to this campaign will also qualify for a dollar matching from the Singapore Government and Toteboard up to $250,000 per charity.

Thank you!All donations to the Season of Giving campaign shall be eligible for dollar matching by the Singapore Government and Tote Board up to cap of $250,000 per charity.

Every year, we all look forward to a special occasion. For some it could be a birthday, for others, a festive season such as Christmas. While we all celebrate these special occasions in our own ways, many also choose to give and share with others who need a little bit more help.

At Canossaville Children and Community Services, our programmes and services are open to our children and their families all year round, with priority given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Education is at the core of what we do and our Canossian Circle of Care provides the supporting structure to children through a preschool, after-school care as well as a child development unit.

This can only be made possible with the support of donors like yourself. We advocate for sustainable giving all year round to support all our programmes and services. In reality, donors tend to only donate at the end of the year during the season of giving.

We acknowledge this and humbly seek your kind support for us to build up enough donations to sustain our programmes and services through the year.

Thank you for not forgetting us during this season of giving. Your special thoughts warm the hearts of our children and their families under our care.

1,Dollar Matching: Empower Children and Adults in CPAS #GivingWeekSG,"Donations are matched by ToteBoard and Government!

Cerebral Palsy is caused by illness or injury to the brain before or during birth, or early in life. Persons living with cerebral palsy often face limitations in their motor functioning, muscle control and may also lose associated functioning in common areas such as speech and hearing.

While cerebral palsy is non-curable, it is also a non-progressive condition that does not necessarily worsen as the person ages. However, access to therapy and intervention can help to alleviate pain and improve the overall functioning and well-being of the person with the condition.

CPAS started over 60 years ago and is the leading social service agency in Singapore working with persons with the condition. Formerly known as the Spastic Children's Association Of Singapore (SCAS), we changed our name to Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore (CPAS) to uphold the dignity of our clients and to better reflect our services and programmes.

Over the years, our association has expanded to serve more clients and provide more comprehensive services through the kind donations from many organisations and individual donors like yourself.

We seek your continued support and donation for us to continue to make a difference to the cerebral palsy community in Singapore.

This campaign is in support of the SG Cares Giving Week movement.

Hi we are Elisha and Tiffany, friends and students from United World College Singapore. We are coming together to do our part for charity this Season of Giving to raise awareness and funds for our chosen charity, Canossaville Children and Community Services (Canossaville).

Founded 80 years ago, Canossaville serves children and those with hearing loss across the preschool and primary ages. From a young age, we were taught to respect everyone and contribute to the well-being of our community. Therefore, when we heard about Canossaville, we saw a wonderful opportunity to help. We can support these children, some of whom may face additional challenges from a young age due to their additional needs or disadvantaged family backgrounds.

Christmas is the one time of the year where everyone comes together as one. To thank family and friends for supporting Canossaville, we will be baking some delicious cookies.

On that note, we thank you for supporting our campaign and your kindness fills the hearts of the children and their families under the care of Canossaville.

Please do share this campaign with your friends or family.

Besides raising awareness of the extraordinary work Lakeside Family Service and volunteers have done. We like to raise funds to support various programs run by Lakeside Family Service that have benefited many former inmates and their families who need support, love, and healing during their rehabilitation.

1,BAG-to-School 2022 for Children in Collaboration with Soulrich Foundation,"The beginning of a new year is usually an exciting time for students as they embark on a new school year. However, for children whose family can barely afford the necessities, a new school term signifies a period of stress and anxiety. The cost of textbooks, stationaries and school attire could add further strain to the families' expenses.

8-year-old Mark's father was incarcerated for drug related offences. His mother was previously a home maker who looked after Mark and his sister full-time. Due to her spouse imprisonment, she had to take up a job at the nearby supermarket working long shifts as the sole bread winner for the family of 3. The family can barely make ends meet and can only afford the necessities. Mark's confidence and self-esteem is affected as he has to borrow stationaries from his classmates at times and had to put on worn out shoes.

Yellow Ribbon Fund together with Soulrich Foundation is seeking support to help fund Back-to-School packs for children like Mark. These packs would include a new school bag, a water bottle and vouchers to make purchase for socks/shoes. Though these are basic items to many, this practical year end gift would mean a lot to our beneficiaries' children. This small boost of confidence would encourage them in the upcoming school year.

Your donation regardless of amount will make a huge difference in the lives of the children we care about. We hope to count on your support to uplift lives of people around us!"

1,Let's Do Good Feel Good this Christmas!,"Food - a basic human need. One might be surprised to learn that hunger still exists in a food paradise and wealthy city-state like Singapore. The situation is worsened by COVID-19, which has hit the disadvantaged the hardest, typically the lowest earners in precarious jobs with no social safety-net protection.

According to a study done by the Singapore Management University's Lien Centre for Social Innovation, one in ten Singaporeans experienced food insecurity at least once over 12 months. Out of this, two in five experienced food insecurity at least once a month.

This is APAC Life, an employee-led group within NatWest Markets APAC and we'd like to invite you to give to The Food Bank Singapore.

Your donation can help more than 100,000 families and over 300,000 people with all kinds of food; from fresh to cooked.

Let's put a smile back on their faces this Christmas by supporting this worthy cause. Do share this fundraising page with your friends and family and thank you very much for your help!"

1,Grant Needy Students Access To Education,"What if your school going child had to put his or her studies on hold? How would you feel? This is a true concern for more than 40% of students in NP who require some form of financial assistance.

Hi! My name is Daren and I am an Alumni of Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I've had 3 fulfilling years at Ngee Ann and I truly am appreciative of the experience.

I wish to step forward to appeal for donations from fellow alumni and members of the public, to support my juniors in need. Education opens up opportunities and no one should be denied access because of one's family background.

I learnt about the establishment of the first ever Ngee Ann Alumni Endowment Fund. Fellow Alumni had banded together to raise a target of $200,000 and are just short of $40,000. The establishment of the NAA Endowment Fund will allow for a set number of Bursaries to be disbursed to deserving students in perpetuity.

Please join me to help them succeed in this effort. Every dollar counts!

Thank you for donating to the Ngee Ann Alumni (NAA) Endowment Fund and for taking time to read my appeal!

DarenDear Fellow Alumni and Donors,

I am Lee Voon Phaw, President, Ngee Ann Alumni (NAA). I graduated from NP many years back but up to today, I still have fond memories of my time in NP. In fact, I met my wife when I was in the Adventure CCA club. We have been happily married for 40 years.

I took on this honorary post as President so that I can give back to NP and do my small part to build a cohesive and active alumni community. The set-up of this NAA Endowment Fund is a very exciting development in the history of NP. It is our first-ever endowment fund to provide long term, sustainable financial aid to needy students. The capital is preserved. Investment returns generated would go to support bursaries for students annually and for years to come.

The NAA Endowment Fund target is $200,000. I am grateful to generous alumni donors who have contributed. However, the fund is still $40,000 short of target.

I would like to appeal to fellow alumni to donate and also rally support from your family, friends for this meaningful cause to offer some relief to those who are struggling to make ends meet. More than 40% or about 6,000 students in NP require some form of financial assistance.

Collectively we can do more for our fellow juniors in need! Every dollar counts and is much appreciated. Eligible donations are entitled to 2.5x tax deduction.

Thank You for your Gift and joining NAA in Helping Generations of Needy Students!

Campaign Update:

""Thank you all for your support and we have raised $5,000 together! As promised, my family shall be pledging $5,000 in matching donations to the campaign. My friend Lindi has also joined me to pledge up to another $5,000 for the next $5,000 raised, hence the first $10,000 donated to the campaign shall be matched dollar for dollar by both of us. Please donate generously if you have not done so.""

As a form of appreciation, our family would be sending out 50 jars of homemade kaya and Lindi would be making 10 chocolate tarts to friends to thank them for their generous donation.

We hope our hardwork would raise awareness to the good work that Canossaville has done for so many years in the low income area of Aljunied and MacPherson.

Please take a look at the campaign photos to find out why I chose to give. I would like to pay forward the kindness we received to uplift the lives of children who may face similar challenges.

Thank you all!All donations to the Season of Giving campaign shall be eligible for dollar matching by the Singapore Government and Tote Board up to cap of $250,000 per charity.

Every year, we all look forward to a special occasion. For some it could be a birthday, for others, a festive season such as Christmas. While we all celebrate these special occasions in our own ways, many also choose to give and share with others who need a little bit more help.

At Canossaville Children and Community Services, our programmes and services are open to our children and their families all year round, with priority given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Education is at the core of what we do and our Canossian Circle of Care provides the supporting structure to children through a preschool, after-school care as well as a child development unit.

This can only be made possible with the support of donors like yourself. We advocate for sustainable giving all year round to support all our programmes and services. In reality, donors tend to only donate at the end of the year during the season of giving.

We acknowledge this and humbly seek your kind support for us to build up enough donations to sustain our programmes and services through the year.

Thank you for not forgetting us during this season of giving. Your special thoughts warm the hearts of our children and their families under our care.

In doing so, we hope to raise funds for the KKH Health Fund to support patients in need of financial assistance for their medical needs.

We first came up with the idea for the Challenge when the medical students in our group reflected on their hospital posting experiences. One experience that stood out was working with families facing the unexpected challenge of chronic diseases in their young children.

With our own teenage years not that far behind us, we can relate closely to the beneficiaries of the fund - the young patients of KKH - and the issues they face, such as schooling, friends, family matters and relationships.

Having ourselves gone through these issues that they have to navigate on top of their illnesses, our hearts do go out to them and we want to express our support by doing something special for them through this sport that has brought us together.

All funds raised through this campaign will go towards supporting patients in need."

1,Birthday Fundraiser for Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH),"With less than 1% of Singapore's population estimated to be visually impaired, they remain a severely overlooked segment of our society. Many who lose their vision struggle with daily tasks and getting around in a society that has yet to embrace the visually-handicapped community. 

For seven decades, SAVH has been serving the blind in Singapore with its rehabilitation, counselling and job placement programmes, all with the goal of helping them to live independent and purposeful lives. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to volunteer at SAVH with my school two years ago, and want to support them again now.

This year, I'm donating my birthday to shed light on this less-known charitable cause, as well as to bring light to the lives of the visually impaired. I will also be matching your donations dollar-for-dollar (up to $500) once this fundraiser closes on 30 December 2021. I greatly appreciate every little bit you contribute!"

1,Sustainability @ Edgefield Secondary,"We are a group of Year 3 students from Edgefield Secondary School. As part of our Values-in-Action (VIA) project, we have partnered with Nature Society Singapore to raise awareness and funds for pollution and deforestation in Singapore.

The Nature Society (Singapore) or NSS is a non-government, non-profit organisation dedicated to the appreciation, conservation, study and enjoyment of the natural heritage in Singapore, Malaysia and the surrounding region. As a team, we want to raise awareness on the issue of pollution and deforestation in Singapore as it is often overlooked by many. Singapore is a highly developed country with extremely limited space, and it comes to no surprise that deforestation is a huge problem in Singapore. However, it might be shocking to some to find out that pollution is a huge problem as well.

Since 1980, development and increased pressure for land usage has led to Singapore losing most of its flora and fauna. Singapore had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.11/10, ranking it 165th globally out of 172 countries. Singapore is more prominently affected by air and light pollution, the air pollution poses a significant risk to health and the light pollution harms the animals in many ways.

Hence, we have decided to raise funds for the cause through this campaign. We hope to receive your utmost support for this initiative to raise awareness and funds to counter deforestation and pollution in Singapore!"

1,Popular Vouchers for Students #AIWFC x #GreatSingaporeGive,"Help low-income families with school-going children.

The end of year season might be a time of celebration and festivities for most people. But for families that are struggling financially, it can be a challenge to manage the additional spending required for their children's education needs such as textbooks, uniforms or shoes for the following year. This Christmas, we want to bless these families with popular vouchers which they may use to purchase textbooks, stationery, etc.

We hope to bless about 80 school-going children with a $50 popular voucher each.

Help us to reach out and touch lives!

Ria* is a single mom with 3 kids. Her youngest is 1 year old, the other two are Primary school students. The family stays in a rental home and Ria* has recently started part-time work after managing to secure subsidy for infant care arrangements.

Bethesda Care Services provides financial assistance to Ria* in the form of monthly grocery vouchers to help alleviate her household expenses. This Christmas, we want to invite you to bless families like Ria's* with popular vouchers for their children's education needs.

Should there be any unused funds left after disbursing the $50 vouchers, funds will be channelled to Bethesda Care Services programmes and services so that we can continue to serve our beneficiaries, the low-income families, youths, children and seniors.

1,Show a little love this season.,"The Chen Su Lan Methodist Children's Home receives children from complex family backgrounds of abuse and neglect. 

For just $10, you can provide 1 day of meals for a child so they have a balanced diet and grow up healthy.

$50 could mean one restaurant meal for us which we spare little thoughts over, but this amount can provide 1 month of programmes for a child to build self-esteem and recover from past trauma.

If you can, $100 can provide tuition for up to 2 children struggling with school work.

$200 can provide for 1 day of meals for 80 of their children and youth.

How about helping these children out so that they can have a slightly better time since Christmas is just two months away?"

1,Butterfly Effect,"Did you know your donation has a butterfly effect? The butterfly effect refers to the theory that a tiny action can cause large effects. I am the living proof of this effect. Not only my promotion as a principal of a kindergarten vanished after I suffered a stroke and has hemiplegic condition at age 38. Doctor advised my family to send me to a nursing home. However, I worked hard in rehabilitation and was ready to enter the employment market after 3 years. High hopes turned to hopeless when I can't find jobs after countless attempts. I approached SPD and was offered training as an administrative trainee in their Sheltered Workshop. I am grateful to SPD for throwing me a life buoy when I'm sinking into depression. Fast forward to today, I was promoted to an executive staff with SPD and soon will be receiving my 15 years long service award. SPD not only allowed me to find my self-esteem and confidence but provide space for me to grow. Without SPD's support, I don't think I will be able to fulfil my dream to continue my study, be a befriender and speaker for more than 11 years spreading awareness of stroke and disabilities. Now I'm a proud grandmother of 2 grand kids and enjoying life with contentment. I do not know how big the butterfly effect will be, but I know it has a great impact on me, my family and everyone around me. I strongly believe SPD will continue to help many more people with disabilities but it's up to donors to create the butterfly effect."
1,Dollar Match: The Never-Ending Gift,"All donations to the Never-Ending Gift Campaign are matched dollar for dollar by the Singapore Government and Tote Board. 

This year, we celebrate the 80th Anniversary of Canossaville and we are grateful for the unwavering support and everlasting faith of our partners and friends. With the dollar match, your donation will go twice as far with double the impact!

Canossaville started as Canossa Orphanage on 15 August 1941, together with Canossa Convent Primary School at Sallim Road in response to the increasingly urgent need to serve the poor in the Geylang-Aljunied area. 

Over the years, the Canossian Sisters and the children endured a war, relocation to Malaysia, expansion, and finally as Canossaville Children and Community Services today. Mother Foundress, St Magdalene, always said that we must change with the sign of the times. As such, Canossaville will continue to grow and strengthen our support for the children, families, and the communities. 

The proceeds from this campaign would ensure that we continue to provide our essential programmes and services to our children and families from all race and faiths, persist in providing early intervention support for our children with hearing loss, and grow and expand our assistance to those in need. 

Please also share this campaign with your families and friends and encourage them to Be a Never-Ending Gift to our children. 

Thank you, and may God bless you!"

Many of our beneficiaries reflected to us that their parents' income has been badly affected and how down they feel. Some of them go to bed hungry, while others find it difficult to focus on their studies.

We would like to ease their financial burdens by providing them with some groceries that can help feed the family. Your donation can go a long way in helping them and making sure they are not left behind in times like these. No contribution is too small. Please help us to keep feeding the children. $200 can support the monthly groceries and daily necessities for a child."
