One such need is that of one of Singapore's most important groups, our migrant workers. As restrictions have tightened for the general population again they have also tightened for this group even further in an effort to stem any possible resurgence of Covid-19 within the dormitories. While this is important and necessary for their safety it does leave them more isolated than the rest of us with basic daily essentials harder to get. We are working with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and a dormitory to help see that this impact is reduced by provided daily essential care packages and providing social support programmes once restrictions are lessened.

We are not only in need of monetary donations but also donations of items such as socks, towel, washing powders, toothpaste, coffee, tea, biscuits, dry rations etc. for a list of currently needed items please contact Chris at 91082083.

ChariTrees will also carry on its tradition to celebrate the community heroes among us who have been actively helping those suffered during the crisis to rebuild their sense of purpose and significance in life. Their extraordinary humanity and compassion towards the community will serve as inspiration to many.

0.321857560283016,0,Reaching the peak for the less privileged,"My name is Arfan Faisal and I am a 21 year old national cyclist.

I'll be the first to admit that I have been more privileged than most as I have had both monetary and emotional support all my life from my parents and many others to do what I love with as little hindrance as possible. However, as I've grown older, I've increasingly realised how lucky I've been and how little others have to even fund basic necessities.

Which is why I've decided to use my abilities in cycling to raise money for the Beyond Social Services charity, that aids many less fortunate families, and especially youths, from across Singapore to break away from the poverty cycle by guidance, care and resources. This allows more youths to be able to focus on school and gain more opportunities to pursue their passions as best they can, as I have been able to.

This Charity will be driven by my attempt to cycle the elevation of Mount Everest - approximately 8,848 m - at Lor Sesuai, in one day, with a goal of a sub 14h attempt."

I represented the children's hope and dreams, in wanting an even better life as they wait for any breakthrough in the medical treatments. For some beneficiaries, their hope is to be able to express their thoughts and feelings to their loved ones, in their own unique ways.

Every child, regardless of their different needs, has the rights to live and be given the fair opportunity to grow and develop their abilities. We are here to love and offer them the quality of life.

For every $77.00 donation you made, RDSS will offer you a Hope to bring home. Please bring Hope along where you are out and take nice photos with Hope while doing your activities. You can then # tag us and share with our beneficiaries your support.

70% of your donations will be channeled to supporting Rare Disease Fund (RDF). For doing so, (from now until 31 December 2021) every dollar of public donation, the Government will match $3, boosting the impact of the RDF.

When making donation, please leave us your contact information - mobile phone number and email address so that we could contact you for the collection of Hope at iROO retail stores."

In the midst of all these certain uncertainties, let's not forget and be mindful of the future of our nation, our children. Every child has the very equal right to excel in all that he/she does in life, and lead Singapore forward to its next chapter. While our nation is ensuring that every child has an equal access to education, let us all band together, to ensure these children go to school without lack in their daily basic needs.

A smile on every child's face is testimony of a very mindful nation and its people."

Meet Rebecca (not her real name), one of the many students who benefit from the services offered at Canossaville Student Care (CSC). Her parents strive daily to make ends meet and are not able to provide the necessary guidance and supervision Rebecca requires at home after school.

Having Rebecca enrolled at CSC provides a safe and conducive environment for Rebecca to thrive. She receives the necessary support to learn and complete her homework. Thanks to the services provided by CSC and emotional support provided by the school to Rebecca and her parents, the situation at home and their relationship has also improved.

Canossaville believes that a holistic approach of care for the whole family will lead to sustainable positive change, and transform their lives for the better. With your help, we can support more families like Rebecca's.

This impact story is part of Canossaville's Digital Fund Campaign. In response to our recurring needs in this area, the Canossaville Digital Fund is designated towards the purchase of digital equipment such as interactive smartboards and iPads, and their accompanying accessories and applications. Specific for our children with hearing loss, the fund will also be used for audio and equipment needs that support assessment and intervention.

Thanks to the support of Tote Board's enhanced fund-raising programme, all donations to this fund, will be matched with an additional 40%!Technology plays a huge part in empowering our children with severe to profound hearing loss. 

Children with hearing loss need more intense and intentional literacy instruction from the early years and throughout their development pathways for literacy acquisition.

Through iPad applications such as Proloquo2Go, our students who have difficulties with speech can finally find a voice to easily and more confidently communicate with others, especially with their families.

Other digital devices such as interactive smartboards allow our teachers to engage students especially those with hearing loss and other learning difficulties, more effectively and efficiently during lessons. It creates opportunities for students to practice collaboration and fosters closer interaction with the lesson materials. Multimedia content are also especially effective at keeping students engaged during class.

Boccia has improved and empowered people with disabilities. It is a game that has been proven to help para athletes develop essential life skills, responsibility, innovation and communication.

Boccia athlete Jeralyn Tan said,

Boccia has improve my quality of life. I wish to inspire other people with disabilities through para sports.

Due to some regulation changes in Boccia, we need to repurchase licensed Boccia equipment's for trainings and competitions. These are quite costly at approximately USD$750 per set (approximately SGD$1000 )

The Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) has kindly set aside some funds for this purpose, but we hope to acquire more sets and increase the number of participation of Boccia athletes participating in training and in competitions.

Hence, I am helping to set this campaign to raise funds for purchase of new licensed balls and increase the number of participations of Boccia para athletes in international games.

All donations here will be channeled 100% towards SDSC for the Boccia team. SDSC will apply to get donations matched dollar-for-dollar under the One Team Singapore Fund, administered by the Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth.

No amount is too little. Reach out and support our para-athletes to achieve their dreams!

Thank You!"
