0,Bro Roger's Journey with Boys' Town,"I am a Brother of the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. I came to Boys' Town (BT) in 1953, and have been in Spore for 68 years since. I was in charge of the tailoring department of BT Vocational Institute and looked after the younger boys in the BT Home for 33 years.

Many of the boys came to BT because of their poor background or had no family. There was one boy that I particularly remembered. He ransacked the cabinets of the other boys, stole their money, and ran away from the home. I heard that he also dealt with issues related to substance use after he left. I never gave up on him - throughout these years, I always remembered him and wanted to be in touch. The boy even asked me ""Why do you care about me? I'm worthless.""

Fast forward to a few years ago when he visited me. He is happily married now with children. Before he left, he cried. He knew how hard I tried to help him, and he did the opposite when he was younger. He felt the concern and affection I had for him, and that to me is the basis of educating young people - you put your heart into it. Whether you are sincere or not, the boys feel it, and they know. 

And now, I am 92. I hope that people will remember me as someone who has a good heart. I would not have come to Spore if not for BT, and I have spent my life here. The times that I spent in BT was a happy one.

0,Walk for You,"Dear friends,

Do you know Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) provides free transportation for low-income cancer patients between their homes and hospitals for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other medical appointments? Such free transportation services are important for the low-income cancer patient as frequent trips to hospital and high transportation cost often discourage them from going for their appointments regularly. Transportation cost alone is a huge financial burden for low-income cancer patient as majority of them is already struggling with their treatment and medication expenses. 

SCS has 2 passenger vans to transport the cancer patient. Unfortunately, one of the passenger van has reached it end of life early this year and the other are due for scrapping at the end of the year. Just as we thought that having 1 passenger van to ferry the needy cancer patients is bad enough, situation got worse as the tightened safety measures has reduced the number of cancer patients in each trip. Imagine only 1 passenger van and so many needy cancer patients waiting/queuing to be pick up.

We are helping SCS to raise money for a new passenger van through charity walk. Our team in groups of 5, will set off from different locations and cover an accumulated distance of 110km in a day. We start our walk at Sembawang and ends in Jurong where SCS temporary HQ is situated.

0,One Dollar Only supports The Reason We Smile - Children Need You,"Children are the reason many of us smile: when we see the wonder in their eyes, and how small and simple things can bring such joy to them. At OneDollarOnly.com.sg, we make it our mission to bring smiles through the simple things in life - a small gift, a simple toy, a kind gesture. We celebrate the role children play in our lives, and we strive to ensure that no child or family gets left behind - and left without a smile.

With the support of OneDollarOnly.com.sg, this campaign contribution will go towards AWWA's Welfare Fund.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented different challenges for everyone, and in the midst of change and uncertainty, it has certainly been extremely difficult for certain more vulnerable families in our society.

Path of Compassion - Virtual Race is initiated by the Youth of Society of St. Vincent de Paul, organised by SSVP Ltd. Funds raised will support SSVP Ltd in their projects and activities. One of their projects is the 'Milk & Diapers' programme which really touches our hearts.

0,ChildAid 2021 in aid of ST SPMF and BT BAF,"ChildAid is an annual charity concert in aid of The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (ST SPMF) and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BT BAF). 

This year's theme, Virtuoso, is inspired by a desire to showcase the creme de la creme of young talents. It will be a hybrid concert with both a physical and virtual audience, and held on 9 December in Resorts World Sentosa. Audiences - both offline and online - will be able to enjoy the talents of our youth, performing to help other youth who are less fortunate than them.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the two charities continue to face challenges in fundraising to help the thousands of beneficiaries under their care. We hope you may open your hearts and support ChildAid 2021 so that together, we can take care of our vulnerable children and youth during this period.

ST SPMF pays for socially disadvantaged school-going children's meals and transport fees, while BT BAF supports financially disadvantaged but artistically talented children's lessons in the performing and visual arts.

Donations will be eligible for 2.5 times tax deduction. ChildAid is jointly organised by The Straits Times and The Business Times."
